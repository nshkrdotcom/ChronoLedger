## Security Guarantees

### Temporal Security Properties

#### 1. Temporal Integrity
**Guarantee**: Chain Time accurately reflects the passage of real-world time within specified bounds.

**Formal Statement**: For any block B with timestamp T, the real-world time when B was created is within [T - ε, T + ε] where ε is the network precision bound.

**Assumptions**: 
- >2/3 of voting weight is controlled by honest TMNs
- Hardware clocks operate within specification
- Network latency is bounded

#### 2. Temporal Consistency
**Guarantee**: Timestamps are monotonically increasing and consistent across the network.

**Formal Statement**: For any two blocks B₁ and B₂ where B₁ precedes B₂, timestamp(B₁) < timestamp(B₂).

#### 3. Temporal Non-Repudiation
**Guarantee**: Hardware-attested timestamps cannot be forged or repudiated.

**Formal Statement**: Any timestamp T with valid hardware attestation A was generated by authentic TMN hardware at real-world time T ± precision.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

#### Safety Property
**Guarantee**: No two honest nodes will commit conflicting blocks at the same height.

**Formal Statement**: If honest nodes commit blocks B₁ and B₂ at height h, then B₁ = B₂.

**Threshold**: Safety guaranteed when malicious voting weight < 1/3 total weight.

#### Liveness Property
**Guarantee**: The network will continue to make progress and commit new blocks.

**Formal Statement**: Under synchronous network conditions, a new block will be committed within bounded time.

**Threshold**: Liveness guaranteed when malicious voting weight < 1/3 total weight.

### Cryptographic Security

#### Computational Security
**Guarantee**: Breaking cryptographic primitives requires computationally infeasible effort.

**Assumptions**:
- Discrete logarithm problem is hard
- Post-quantum assumptions hold
- Hash functions are collision-resistant
